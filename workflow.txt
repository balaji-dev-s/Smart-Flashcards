1. storage.js – Core Data Layer
Purpose: Centralized storage for all decks in localStorage. Provides functions to:

--->Get all decks (getDecks)
--->Add a new deck (addDeck)
--->Delete a deck (deleteDeck)
--->Get a deck by its ID (getDeckById)
--->Reorder decks (reorderDecks)
--->Generate unique IDs (generateId)

Usage in other files:

deckList.js, flashcard.js, editDeck.js, deckDetail.js, and library.js 
all depend on storage.js to fetch, update, or save deck data.

Think of it as a database layer for your browser app.
